![](https://progress-bar.dev/100/?title=Magic:&width=150)  ![](https://progress-bar.dev/100/?title=Logisim:&width=150)

**Milestone Checklist**
- [x] Preliminary project cell layouts: defines full schematic hierarchy and functionality.
- [x] updated version of your milestone #2 writeup with any changes based on comments made. [ updated MS#2 submission with errors fixed (Canvas)]
  - [x] conclusion is missing.
  - [x] drop multiplication for ALU
  - [x] schematic is not working
  - [x] demonstrate loading of values to the reg file and operating on them
  - [x] Please only include one test harness. It should consist of input pins, output ins, and a single part. 
  - [x] Please turn off the three-state inputs on your input pins
  - [x] DFFs have serious design flaws. Please fix Logisim simulation is not working.
  - [x] Many of the layouts submitted have design errors in them.
  - [x] Please include .cmd files to demonstrate that the layouts simulate proerly
- [x] complete Logisim/LogicWorks schematic (Canvas command)
- [x] .cmd test files for IRSIM (turnin command)
- [x] partially complete set of Magic layouts for standard cells (these should only be submitted if DRC correct) (turnin command)

**Progress**
- [x] Logisim functional (unless bugs/issues encountered)
- [x] magic gate layouts
- [x] make a single block as top level
- [x] make sure all magic simulates properly (will help us in the long run before we build the parts)
- [x] build MUX3 in magic?
- [x] build Register File in magic?
- [x] build ALU in magic?

**Issues**
- [x] Fix DFF incorrect output
- [x] Fix Oscillation Apparent

**Workload**
- [x] Remove Multiplier
- [x] 8 bits to 4 bits
- [ ] Remove MUX3?
- [ ] cut down number of registers? (8 registers currently)

Abstract:
This project shows three crucial blocks: MUX3, Register File, and Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The MUX3 selects data for storage in the Register File, which features 8 registers and dynamic address selection. The ALU performs arithmetic operations based on user selection, producing 4-bit results. Also, the ALU's output loops back to the MUX3, forming a crucial feedback loop for iterative calculations. Understanding these blocks is essential for understanding computing systems.

Parts: MUX3, Reg File, ALU
